    "## Random Sampling Techniques:\n",
    "1. **Simple random sampling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Every object in the population has and equal chance of being selected \n",
    "    - Objects are selected independently\n",
    "    - Samples can be obtained from a table of random numbers or computer random number generator\n",
    "    - Simple random sample is the ideal against which other sample methods are compared\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Stratified Random sampling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Population is divided into non-overlapping subpopulations called strats\n",
    "    - Each item in each strata is homogenous\n",
    "    - A random sample is selected from each stratum\n",
    "    - Potential for reducing sampling error\n",
    "    - Two types Proportionate and Disproportionate -- \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **a. Proportionate**\n",
    "    \n",
    "        the percentage of these sample taken from each stratum is proportionate to the percentage that each stratum is within the population.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **b. Disproportionate**\n",
    "        \n",
    "        proportions of the strata within the sample are different than the proportions of the strata within the population\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Systematic Random Sampling**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - COnvienient and relatively easy to administer \n",
    "    - Population elements are an ordered sequence (at least, coceptually)\n",
    "    - The first element is slected randomly from the first k population elements\n",
    "    - Threafter  sample elements are selected at a constant interval k from the ordered sequence frame\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cluster (or Area) Sampling**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Population is divided into non overalpping clusters or areas\n",
    "    - Each cluster is a miniature of the population\n",
    "    - A subset of the clusters is selected randomly for the sample\n",
    "    - If the number of elements in the subset of clusters is larger than the desiserd value of n, thses clusters may be subdivided to form a new st of clusters and subjected to random selection process.\n",
    "    \n",
    "** Note - Difference between stratified sample vs cluster: Each items in a stratum is homogenous, but in cluster it is highly hetrogeneous. Thus each cluster will act like a populaton. Each cluster will have similar characteristics but different variance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "      Advantage :\n",
    "      \n",
    "      * More convinient for geographically dispersed populations\n",
    "      * Reduced travel costs to contact sample elements\n",
    "      * Simplified administration of the survey\n",
    "      * Unavailable of sampling frame prohibits using other random sampling methods\n",
    "      \n",
    "      Disadvanatges:\n",
    "      \n",
    "      * Statistically less efficient when the cluster elements are similar\n",
    "      * Costs and problem of statistical analysis are grater than for simple random sampling\n"
